i dont know how to get the sounds from the digicam print channel, <br> the only one i have at the moment is the news_scroll_HQ.. <br> i found it, but not sure how to perfectly lower the tempo/pitch to match the beta version. <br> every other sound is not HD as its from one of those old beta wii videos.
<br>
if ur able to rip these sounds in HD from the digicam print channel, lmk by email:
